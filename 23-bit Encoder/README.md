# 23-bit encoder

The AS38-H39E offers 23-bit single-turn and 16-bit multi-turn counts, hence a combined 39-bit high resolution.

op_encoder.c and op_encoder.h have functions to read the 23-bit-precision angle within 360 degrees.
main.c has some examples.
The datasheet and circuit diagram are also included.
